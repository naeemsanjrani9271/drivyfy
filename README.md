# Drivyfy Student Ride-Sharing Platform

## Abstract
Drivyfy is a student ride-sharing platform aiming to provide safe, affordable, and convenient transportation solutions for students. It connects students who need rides with peers who have available seats in their vehicles, fostering community, reducing transportation costs, and promoting sustainable practices.

In today's fast-paced world, transportation can be a significant hurdle for students. Drivyfy facilitates ride-sharing among students, enabling them to share rides to and from their institutions, thus improving access to education and social activities.
